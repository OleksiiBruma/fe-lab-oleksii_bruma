 - .boat - the boat must emulate up/down motion and move from left to the center;
 - .sun - the sun must rotate;
 - .cloud -the cloud - must move from right to left and cover the sun after that background on (.animation-box) must be changed from transparent to #262F37;.
 - .move-boat:after - this is the smoke. Must change translate and opacity;
 - animation must be started after user hover the (.animation-box)
