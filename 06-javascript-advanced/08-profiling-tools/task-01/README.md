## DESCRIPTION:

Goal of this task is to get familiar with Performance tab, that is starting point of the performance profiling.

Open `index.html` in the browser (do not open DevTools at first).

Try to scroll the page up and down. The result will be noticeable that strongly inhibits page.

Find all the possible causes of the slow rendering.

1. Use Performance and Rendering(in drawer) to analyze to problems with rendering

2. Prepare file with answers to following question

    2.1. What problems do exist (problems with js, styles etc.) and how you found them?

    2.2. How you suggest to solve it?

3. Apply suggestions to document and check if problems were solved

    3.1 Repeat step 2 if needed.

## REQUIREMENTS:

* Use the Google Chrome DevTools to find problematic parts of code

* Create `task-01.txt` ( or `task-02.md` ) which should contain:

    * list of problems (and how they are perceived by users)

    * step-by-step way on how to find them (add screenshots if it will help to describe)

    * suggested solutions for these problems (replacing code with more performant alternatives, avoiding unnecessary operations, reducing UI bloat)

* Try to fix performance problems and commit updated file
