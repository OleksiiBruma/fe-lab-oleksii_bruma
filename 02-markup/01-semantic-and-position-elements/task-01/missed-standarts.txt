The file style.css were created to separate html and css.

HTML
1. <!DOCTYPE html> were missed;
2. Better to put all styles to the separate file;
3. Use double quotes;
4. Value of attributes should be in double quotes;
5. Indentings were missed;
6. Charset="UTF-8" were missed;
7. Link to the font can be merged and type can be omitted;
8. Missed alt attributes in img tag; 
9. Div was used instead of nav;
10. Div was used instead of footer;
11. Tag body was not closed;
12. Divs with classes main-nav, about, 
experiences, achievements, skills should be replaced with section;
13. Use semantic tags;
14. Attribute order should be as follow - class, id, name, data-*, src, for,
type, href, value, title, alt, aria-*, role.
15. Lang attribute missed.
16. <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">  only needed to support old IE browsers and should consist content="IE=edge" attribute (commented);
17. H1 can be only one;

CSS
1. URL(<link>) link should be without double quotes. 
2. Avoid 0px/0% - 0 is always 0;
3. Unknown property  -ms-transition;
4. Use shorthands for example padding : 0 0 0 0;
5. Useless of the keyframe (commented);
6. Don`t use !important (left due to kube.css); 
7. Useless  .intro were deleted;
8. Sprite can be used for link images (Facebook, Google)
but they are too small in this task, so I think we can avoid them; 
9. Media should be at the bottom;
